# Kristjan Sever's Data Science Project Competition journal

## March 2025 (14h)
* 16. (5h): Playing with Folium maps and geopandas provided file.
* 17. (4h): Reading the market Analysis paper provided by Tomaz.
* 20. (5h): Playing with data and reading documentation for libraries and data.

## April 2025 (12h)
* 5. (4h): Played with Medius Data a bit, made some initial distributions.
* 22. (4h): Read through OSRM API, which could prove useful for calculating how probable some point is based on distance from roads.
* 23. (4h): Start working on getting probabilities of each point, so we could use some threshold to filter outliers..

## May 2025 (40h)
* 2. (8h): Login to Arnes Cluster, set OTP, try to read from Juans home directory, and try to find a workaround since it was not possible. Try to set up a conda environment locally. Finally decide to just set the Singularity containers with desired conda environment. Try to get Jupyter notebooks to work by ssh to Arnes.
* 3. (10h): Play with Folium a bit, get a feel of how it works and what use-case we could have with it. Visualize a couple of transitions of users. Try to see any pattern, check how the users locations change, how much time passes, are the points useful, think about how to denoise it.
* 9. (4h): Get slovenian railway and road geojsons.
* 10. (10h): Visualize the geojsons a bit, think about how this could prove useful to the project (by getting more accurate distributions of modes of transportation across the specified bins).
* 10. (8h): Clean up the repo a bit. Work on transition matrix a bit. Fixing issue with .parquet files not opening as they should on my local machine. Talk with Juan about splitting the .parquets a bit to allow local work.
