* 25. (4h): Data denoising pipeline and stats comparison.
* 26. (12h): Re-estructuring the pipeline as Arnes + Singularity + Dask proved to be incompatible with the nature of the project. Headstart on binning discretization.

* 2. (5h): Finalizing working binning code with working zone ID join.
* 3. (6h): Spatial binning debug and intermediate Parquet save.
* 4. (4h): Refactoring pipeline to include speed computation.
* 5. (6h): Fixing Dask shift metadata warnings, debugging transition matrix.
* 6. (6h): Cleaning up the transition matrix, fixing time bin presence in matrices.
* 8. (5h): Exploring better chunk partitioning strategies.
* 12. (4h): Adding time-awareness to transition matrices
* 13. (4h): Meeting with Ali and Kristjan, discussing denoising strategies and what the pipeline should end up looking like.
* 14. (4h): Evaluating memory usage (evaluating possibility of running on 60 GB, fail).
* 17. (6h): Matrix normalization, export, and visualization checks on visual imshow and map.
* 20. (6h): Working on binning pipeline and export compatibility.
